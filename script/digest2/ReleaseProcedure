0.  Preparation:  Make source changes, test, commit.  Review README and doc.go
    for needed changes.  Push changes to Google code.

1.  Ensure that copies of astorb.dat in C and Go/muk directories are identical
    and that it is a fairly recent download.

2.  Check Google code to verify last published version and decide what this
    version will be.

3.  For C source:
    3.1  Update version number in digest2.c
    3.2  make.
    3.3  Test -v option of digest2.
    3.4  Update README.  (Search. There may be multiple places to change.)
         For sections with example output, run digest2, check that new output
         is consistent with old output, replace example output with new output.
    3.5  Test.

4.  For Go source
    4.1  Update version number in digest2.go.  It should match the C version.
    4.2  go install digest2
    4.3  Test -v option.
	4.4  If you updated astorb.dat, rerun muk
    4.5  Update doc.go as for c/README.
    4.6  Repeat 4.1-1.5 as need for muk, s3mbin, mcc.  These version numbers
         should change only if the programs or imported packages have changed.
         The version numbers do not have to match the digest2 version.
    4.7  go install go/...
    4.8  Test.

5.  Commit.  Tag with version number.  Push.
6.  go get to a fresh directory.

7.  Go
    7.1  Test go/muk, go/digest2 as downloaded.
    7.2  go install and test go/s3mbin, go/mcc.

8.  C
    8.1  make and test c/muk, c/digest2 as downloaded
    8.2  tar cjf digest2.c.<version number>.tar.bz2 <exactly the files listed
         in README>.
    8.4  Test the bz2 in a clean directory.
    8.5  Upload release archive.

9.  Update the project home text on code.google.com/p/digest2.
