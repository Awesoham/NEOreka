NEOreka!
=========

This project aims to create a social network for those planet hunters who spend hours glued to those Barlows in search of little planets and NEOs. It's meant to promote discussion and vetting of new finds with the ultimate goal of giving that much-needed fast-forward to amateur planet-hunting.
It's mostly written in Ruby on Rails, with bits of JavaScript and CSS here and there.

NEOreka was made by [Awesoham](http://awesoham.wordpress.com).
